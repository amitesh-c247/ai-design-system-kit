# Project Structure Guide

This is a Next.js 15 React admin dashboard project with TypeScript. The main entry point is [src/app/layout.tsx](mdc:src/app/layout.tsx), which uses the app router structure.

## Key Directories
- **src/app/**: Next.js app router pages and layouts
- **src/components/**: Reusable UI components organized by feature
- **src/hooks/**: Custom React hooks for business logic
- **src/services/**: API service layer for backend communication
- **src/utils/**: Utility functions and helpers
- **src/constants/**: Application constants and configuration
- **src/locales/**: Internationalization files using next-intl
- **src/assets/**: Static assets like images and icons

## Custom Types & Interfaces Organization
- **Centralized types**: Place all shared types and interfaces in `src/types/`, subdivided by domain if needed (e.g. `auth.ts`, `ui.ts`, `cms.ts`).
- **Component/feature types**: If a type/interface is only used by a single component or feature, define it in a `types.ts` file within that folder. If it becomes shared, move it to `src/types/`.
- **Naming**: Use `PascalCase` for interfaces/types. Suffix props interfaces with `Props` (e.g. `UserCardProps`).
- **Imports**: Always import types/interfaces from the central types directory or local `types.ts`, not from implementation files.
- **No implementation in types files**: Types/interfaces files should only contain type definitions, not functions or classes.

**Example:**
```
src/
  types/
    auth.ts
    ui.ts
    cms.ts
    index.ts
  components/
    UserCard/
      UserCard.tsx
      types.ts   // (for component-specific types)
```

**Why?**
- Discoverability: Developers can easily find and reuse types.
- Maintainability: Changes to types/interfaces are centralized.
- Scalability: As your app grows, type management remains organized.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **UI Libraries**: React Bootstrap, Ant Design, Radix UI
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Styling**: SCSS modules with Bootstrap
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Yup/Zod validation
- **Internationalization**: next-intl
- **Testing**: Storybook, Vitest, Playwright

## Path Aliases
- `@/*` maps to `src/*` for absolute imports
- Always use absolute imports from `@/` instead of relative paths
